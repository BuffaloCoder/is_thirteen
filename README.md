# IsThirteen

This library is created in an attempt to increase the parity between Elixir and Node. Too many times, when searching for a library, you'll see that Node has just the package for it, but Elixir is still catching up. Node has [is-thirteen](https://github.com/jezen/is-thirteen), now Elixir has this!

This is just some random library copy to better understand Elixir. The simpler the library, the more straightforward the comparison. It is not really meant for production, or to be taken seriously. Enjoy!

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add is_thirteen to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:is_thirteen, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure is_thirteen is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:is_thirteen]]
        end
